    <h1>What is Hui Gong Ge Paper?</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Hui Gong Ge Paper</b> is a special Chinese writing template
      with a flexible grid design.
    </p>

    <p>
      The recurring motif for the variations of the design is that
      the concenctric rectangles form a donut (<a rel="ugc" 
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut">doughnut</a>) 
      shape on each grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hui gong ge (<span class="kaiti">回宫格</span>) grid provides
      an inner guideline and outer boundary for Chinese character practice.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The Chinese word that "looks like" donut is
      <a rel="ugc" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/回">return 回</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can type "hui" in your preferred
      <a rel="ugc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_input_method">pinyin
      input method editor</a> to easily find the character.
    </p>

    <p>

      tricky with a traditional brush, so using a pen or brush pen is highly
      recommended.

      paper template is a good choice. You will be focused on keep your
      characters within a reasonable size while working on form and quality.

      lines provides the perfect template for formal instruction by a teacher or tutor.
