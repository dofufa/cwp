      Of course, the Chinese word that best describes the template is
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/方">square 方</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can type "fang" in your preferred
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_input_method">pinyin
      input method editor</a> to easily find the character.
    </p>

    <p>

      Writing fast, legible characters is the key to achieving good scores
      on quizzes and exams.
