      <b>Fang ge zhi (paper)</b> is probably familiar to most students
      learning Chinese as a second language.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Chinese character writing practice template features a tightly-packed
      grid of squares designed for repetitive practice of character strokes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, the Chinese word that best describes the template is
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/方">square 方</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can type "fang" in your preferred
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_input_method">pinyin
      input method editor</a> to easily find the character.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learners who practice with this particular Chinese writing paper template are often
      hastily repeating the character stroke orders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing fast, legible characters is the key to achieving good scores
      on quizzes and exams.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the learner has forgotten how to write certain characters, fang ge zhi
      is the best fastest and cheapest Chinese writing paper template
      to re-learn how to write them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fang ge zhi tend to have the most practice tiles per page, allowing
      more writing attempts per printed sheet of paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teachers may use these sheets for quizzes, exams or mandatory Chinese
      writing practice. Another usage is recitation of a short essay or a list
      of vocabulary from memory.
    </p>

      additional row characters on this Chinese writing paper template. This
