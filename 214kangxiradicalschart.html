      <b>214 Kangxi Radicals Chart</b> is the essential reference in
      a modern Chinese dictionary.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The concept is simple. You should be able to lookup any Chinese character
      based on the identifying radical or groups of radicals.
    </p>

      
    <p>
      Chinese character input method edtiors using the Wubi method use the
      Kangxi radical chart as a basis for character entry.
    </p>

    <p>
      When studying Chinese (and seriously trying to learn Chinese), you should
      place a giant Kangxi radicals poster on your wall so that you have a ready
      reference to the 214 radicals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, as you memorize the chart, you will be able to navigate modern
      Chinese dictionaries more quickly. You will also develop the important
      skill of Chinese character decomposition.
