      <b>Tian zi ge paper</b> is divided into four sections. You can see this Chinese writing paper
      tempate used in primary school for the introduction of new characters with simple layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both <a href="/paper/mizige.html">mi zi ge paper</a> and tian zi ge paper are popular
      grid formats, due to widespread use in textbooks and workbooks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, tian zi ge practice grids are combined with rectangles above the squares to allow
      room for the learner to write Hanyu Pinyin or phonetic symbols.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shape of the grid guidelines look like the Chinese character
      for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/田">field 田</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Chinese writing practice paper template can also be called <b>Field Grid Paper.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can type "tian" in your
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_input_method">pinyin input method editor</a>
      to easily find the character.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find tian zi ge paper bound in a notebook called <b>tian ge ben</b>. This notebook
      is often required for note taking and mandatory Chinese character practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spacing of the practice grids varies based on the objective of the character lesson.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the goal is for the learner to simply retain the character and the pronunciation,
      the grids will touch horizontally, but there will substantial vertical space between
      practice lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if the goal of the Chinese character practice session is to improve legibility
      and character quality, then the grids will be tightly packed and evenly-spaced
      throughout the Chinese writing paper template.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tian zi ge paper is not designed for fast writing, like paper with smaller practice tiles.
      Instead, the learner should focus on clean, neat and deliberate strokes.
