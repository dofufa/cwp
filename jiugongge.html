      While <a href="tianzige.html">tian zi ge paper</a> would suffice for
      learning very basic Chinese characters, jiu gong ge helps the learner
      break up complex characters into smaller, manageable sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/九">nine 九</a>
      is the best way to describe this grid format.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can type "jiu" in your preferred
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_input_method">pinyin
      input method editor</a> to easily find this basic number character.
    </p>

      This Chinese character writing template will help learners improve
      the proportions of characters over extended practice
      for improved penmanship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the other specialized Chinese character writing practice templates,
      jiu gong ge is designed to help the learner carefully practice pen
      or brush strokes.
